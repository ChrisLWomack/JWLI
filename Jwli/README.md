# My Awesome Jwlia
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

In the project I mimicked the original Jwlia site to the bets of my abilities. I chose and placed content using HTML, and rearranged the content and styled using CSS.


## Lessons Learned:

During the construction of this webpage, I learned how to take away height values from my sections and instead let the content stretch them and use padding for additional space.
